## General Note

There will typically be three files for each
mini stats project; one will contain the code (**.R**), another will be markdown
(**.Rmd**) that produces the last (**.pdf**) which can be viewed directly in github.
The (.pdf) file description includes the task description.



## File Descriptions

#### one\_factor.r

A script file containing the code used in the “.rmd” files.

#### one\_factor.rmd

A markdown file with an output converted to “.pdf” for github viewer
compatibility.

#### one\_factor.pdf

Viewable output of one\_factor.rmd file. This project explores the
assumptions of the ANOVA test in the one factor (one-way) setting using Citibike data, and
various tools available in R to verify these assumptions prior to
conducting the analysis. Some tools explored in this analysis are as
follows: Shapiro-Wilk’s Normality Test, Levene’s Test for Equality of
Variance, Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference Test, distribution
visualization (histograms, boxplots), and further exploratory data
analysis.
