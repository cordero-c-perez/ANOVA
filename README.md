One Factor ANOVA
================
C. Perez

## Project Description

An ongoing project to explore and understand various R methods used to
verify ANOVA assumptions. There will typically be three files for each
project; one will contain the code (**.R**), another will be markdown
(**.Rmd**), and the last (**.pdf**) can be viewed directly in github.
The (.pdf) file description includes the associated project description.
 

## Description of Files

#### one\_factor.rmd

A markdown file with an output converted to “.pdf” for github viewer
compatability.

#### one\_factor.pdf

Viewable output of one\_factor.rmd file. This project explores the
assumptions of the ANOVA test in the one factor (one-way) setting, and
various tools available in R to verify these assumptions prior to
conducting the analysis. Some tools explored in this analysis are as
follows: Shapiro-Wilk’s Normality Test, Levene’s Test for Equality of
Variance, Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference Test, distribution
visualization (histograms, boxplots), and further exploratory data
analysis.

#### one\_factor.r

A script file containg the code used in the “.rmd” files.

#### README.rmd

This file creates a README.md file for the repository.

###### Note: Citibike data is not provided in the repository.
